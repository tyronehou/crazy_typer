# Crazy Typer
A simple and fun automated script that uses the selenium webdriver for python to
achieve high scores on the English typing test from [10 Fast Fingers](http://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english)

## Installation
Make sure you have [Python 3] (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) browser installed on your computer.

The script depends on the selenium Webdriver API bindings for python.

To install the selenium for python type
```sh
$ pip3 install selenium
```
## Running
The script can be run in your favorite IDE like any other normal python script.

To run the script from the command line type
```sh
$ python3 ./crazytyper.py
```
Crazy Typer will automatically open a Firefox browser and go to the 10 Fast Fingers website.
Press enter to start typing, then sit back and watch.
